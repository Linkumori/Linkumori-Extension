# Linkumori Contributor Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering an open, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone involved in the **Linkumori** project.

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces including this repository, issue trackers, discussions, communication channels, and any private interactions that stem from participation in the project.

## Community Guidelines

### Be Respectful and Kind
All interactions should reflect mutual respect. Critique ideas, not people. Assume good intentions and communicate constructively — especially across different time zones, cultures, and language proficiencies.

### Focus on the Work
Conversations should remain focused on the project:
- Talk about **features**, **code**, and **design decisions**.
- Avoid personal remarks, gatekeeping, or dismissive behavior.

### Everyone is Welcome
Diversity of thought and background is a strength. We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or marginalization of any kind.

### Speak Up, Safely
If you witness behavior that violates these guidelines:
- Address it politely if you’re comfortable.
- Otherwise, report it confidentially to the maintainers via the project’s primary contact email.

We encourage speaking up, but we understand not everyone feels safe doing so. Your voice matters.

## Unacceptable Behaviors

The following actions are not allowed under any circumstance:

- Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments
- Harassment, intimidation, or stalking
- Disruptive behavior in threads or pull requests
- Sexualized language or imagery
- Persistent unwanted communication
- Doxing (sharing private information)
- Encouragement of self-harm

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in the following, at the discretion of the maintainers:

- Formal warnings
- Removal of privileges (e.g. commenting, issue creation)
- Temporary or permanent bans from the project and community spaces

Any repeated or serious breach may result in permanent exclusion.

## Appeals

If you believe an action taken under this Code of Conduct was unjust or incorrect, you may appeal by writing to the maintainers.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Chromium Code of Conduct](https://www.chromium.org/about/community/conduct/), which is based on the Geek Feminism and Django Codes of Conduct.
